    <h1>Sam's philosophy of fine dining</h1>

    <p>Here at sam's, we know that good food isn't just about how expensive the dish is. We're proud of our work, our quality, our
        environment, and our love for food and family. </p>
    <p>Oh! and you can call us sam's. You're family here.</p>
